loop4r_leds for the leds on the FCB1010 with the EurekaProm
set to I/O mode. The goal is to allow control of sooperlooper via just the
controller and have the LEDs etc reflect the state of sooperlooper.

This is the Raspberry Pi (Linux only) version of the led writer that
works in conjunction with the loop4r_read program at
